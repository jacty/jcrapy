class JcrapyPriorityQueue:
    """A priority queue implemented using multiple internal queues (typically,
    FIFO queues). It uses one internal queue for each priority value. The internal
    queue must implement the following methods:

        * push(obj)
        * pop()
        * close()
        * __len__()

    ``__init__`` method of JcrapyPriorityQueue receives a downstream_queue_cls
    argument, which is a class used to instantiate a new (internal) queue when
    a new priority is allocated.

    Only integer priorities should be used. Lower numbers are higher
    priorities.

    startprios is a sequence of priorities to start with. If the queue was
    previously closed leaving some priority buckets non-empty, those priorities
    should be passed in startprios.
