How to write a Git commit message

A diff will tell you what changed but only the Commit Message can properly tell you WHY.

1. First line capitalized with less than 50 characters and separated from the body with a blank line.
2. Write in imperative and present tense.
3. No whitespace errors. Use git diff —check to check it.
4. A commit should contain exactly one logical change including adding a new feature, fixing a specific bug, etc. If it is not possible to describe the change in a few words, it is most likely too complex for a single commit.
5. Describe the intent, the approach and  the effects rather than the code. Explain how things worked before this commit, what has changed, and how things work now.
6. Don’t end the summary line with a period - it is a title and titles don’t end with a period.
7. A properly formed commit subject line should always be able to complete this sentence: If applied, this commit will DO STH.
